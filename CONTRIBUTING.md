## Filling issue

The issue system is the central place to report problems but also to state intentions.
Each modification (bug fix, enhancement, new feature, ...) or intention must be reported using the issue tracker.
Ideally before acting.

If you have the rights to do so, flag your issue to a milestone and label it.
This eases a lot the creation of the changelog.
